It's super simple, we first need to make an alias, just copy and paste the below code on your git bash or terminal:

```
git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --all"
```
> You can any choose any other color of your choice for the logs

and now every time you need to see your logs, just type in ```
git lg
``` or if you want to see just the lines that changed then type ```
git lg -p
```.

That is pretty much it, if you've liked this article share it with your friends and colleagues!ðŸ˜€
