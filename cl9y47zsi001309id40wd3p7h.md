# How to store Javascript array in localStorage?

Web storage object ```
localStorage
``` allows us to store data in the browser. The data is stored in the form of key/value pair and is shared between all windows from the same origin. Unlike the sessionStorage, the data stored in the localStorage is not cleared when we close the tab or in fact when we close the browser completely.

One important thing to note about localStorage is, it can only store strings (both the key/value pair in localStorage should be of type string). This brings us to the question - **How to store arrays in localStorage?**


## JSON methods to rescue
There are two JSON methods that can help us in this scenario:

- ```
JSON.stringify()
``` - converts an array into a string

- ```
JSON.parse()
``` - parses a string and constructs an array from it

## Storing an array in localStorage
To store an array in localStorage, we first need to convert it into a string.

### Converting an array into a string
We can use ```
JSON.stringify
``` to convert an array into a string.

Let's say we have an array of users

```
const users = ["John", "Mark", "Peter"];
``` 
We can convert it into a string as follows:

```
JSON.stringify(users)
``` 


The above code will convert ```
users
``` array into a single string.
### Store data in localStorage
Now, we can use ```
localStorage.setItem()
``` method to store the data in localStorage. 

```
localStorage.setItem(key, value)
```

The method takes two parameters:
- key: It specifies the name of the key
- value: It specifies the value that we want to store

Run the below code to store ```
users
``` array into localStorage:

```
localStorage.setItem('allUsers', JSON.stringify(users))
// here 'allUsers' is the key and 'users' is the value
```  
At this point, we should be able to open the "Application" tab in our browser's console and we should see the output as follows:

As we can see, our ```
users
``` array has been added to the localStorage successfully. ðŸŽ‰

## Retrieving data from localStorage
Okay! So after storing the data if we want to retrieve it, we can use ```
localStorage.getItem()``` method.

```
localStorage.getItem(key)
```
The method only takes one parameter:

- key: It specifies the name of the key whose value you want to get


### Convert the retrieved string into an array 
Once we have retrieved the data, we can convert it into an array using ```
JSON.parse()
``` method as follows:

```
const savedUsers = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('allUsers'));
``` 
If you have been following along, you can find the complete code below:

```
const users = ["John", "Mark", "Peter"];
localStorage.setItem('allUsers', JSON.stringify(users))

const savedUsers = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('allUsers'));
``` 
This is how we can store and retrieve array from localStorage.
